Hello-World
===========

My first repo on GitHub yay!

Hey! My name is Susana and I'm a Economics first year student. Among the courses I've taken so far, my favorites are the ones from the statistics core. The more I learn from Open Source tools applied to Economic data, the more I want to learn. Even if I've been afraid of programing in the past, I feel pumped up and motivated to become a data scientist rock star :D

English is my second language. My native is Spanish and I am currently learning Japanese as well.
