Hello-World
===========

My first repo on GitHub yay!

Hey! My name is Susana and im a Economics first year student. Among the courses i've taken so far, my favorites are the ones from the statistics code. The more I learn from Open Source tools, the more I want to learn. Even if I've been afraid of programing, but now I feel pumped up and motivated to become a data scientist rock star :D
